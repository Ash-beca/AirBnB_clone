# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

## Project Description

This is the AirBnB Clone project, focusing on creating a command-line interface (CLI) or console to manage AirBnB objects. The project will gradually evolve to encompass various aspects of web development, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, APIs, and front-end integration.

### Key Tasks:

- Implement a parent class (BaseModel) for object initialization, serialization, and deserialization.
- Establish a flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file.
- Create classes representing AirBnB objects (e.g., User, State, City, Place) that inherit from BaseModel.
- Develop the first abstracted storage engine for the project: File storage.
- Create comprehensive unit tests to validate all classes and the storage engine.
